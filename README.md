# About
We are currently under active development.
Games and Stuff is a frontend UI for launching games hosted online. I mainly use repl.it to host, but by editing the source code you can redirect to what ever.
# Launcher
The main interface. It is written in Haxe using OpenFL and HaxeFlixel.
It is represented as `launch`.
## Build Instructions
Before building, you'll need to install Haxe. Go to [https://haxe.org/download/](https://haxe.org/download/) and install it.

Once it is installed, open your terminal as admin and write the commands:
```
haxelib install flixel

haxelib install flixel-addons

haxelib install openfl

haxelib install lime

haxelib run lime setup
```

Then run any of the bat files, then it should work!
For native builds, make sure you have at least 2GB of space.
## Platforms
Currently supported platforms are:
Windows, iOS WebApp, Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S via Microsoft Edge and the Web.
I plan to expand support to PS5 Browser, Nintendo Switch hidden browser via [SwitchBru](https://switchbru.com/dns), and native applications for Linux and macOS.
You can read on how to install it on each device [here](https://github.com/ethpsa09/gamesandstuff/wiki/Installation).
# Shortcut
An easy to access way to go directly to games and stuff without having to install the entire launcher. It is written in HTML.
It is represented as `cut`.
## Platforms
Windows only for now as it is an HTA Application.
# Disclaimer
Some of the things that are in my app I do not own, such as game logos and game characters.
An update will be out soon where it adds the developers of the games under the game logo.
